# Homework 1

## On the project you are currently doing:
- What Signal Processing is being done?
- What DSP hardware?  FPGA? DSP? PC? Etc.
- Which ADC and DAC?  How many bits?  What is the sample rate?

**NOTE:** If there is no DSP on your project, go ask about a different project.

## Using either Matlab, Simulink, or Python
- Create a signal composed of multiple sinusoids of different frequencies
- Sample this signal at different sampling rates
    - What is the minimum sampling rate allowed?
- Quantize the signal, using quantizing levels (i.e. different numbers of bits)
- Analyze the spectrum of the signal
  - How does the quantizing level affect the noise floor of the spectrum?
  - For each new bit added, how much does the noise floor decrease?
