# FFT

## Calculate and plot spectrum of delta, rect, and comb functions

## Compare convolution in time domain with convolution in freq domain

#### Generate two signals  (one with at least 1024 samples, the other with at least 16 samples)

#### Write a function to convolve them in time domain, and write a function to do convolution via multiplication  in frequency domain


#### Compare and contrast output of both functions  (They should be the same)

#### Measure time spent on each function

#### Does processing time change with length of signals?
